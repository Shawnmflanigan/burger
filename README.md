# Wimpy's Burger Logger

## Description

This application uses handlebars, express, a MySQL database and a custom ORM to handle user input on the main interface. This project follows the MVC pattern. The deployed site illustrates these operations by allowing a user to 'create' and 'destroy'(eat) burgers and displays the eaten burgers in another column.
